# LCPB-PROJECT
In this project we work with Taurex, a fully bayesian inverse atmospheric retrieval framework, to obtain a retrieval spectrum of the planet GJ3470B obtained from NASA Exoplanet Archive. Additionally we work with Message Passing Interface (MPI) to parallelize the work over the available computer resources
